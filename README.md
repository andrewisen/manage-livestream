# Manage Livestream
Simple website for managing a livestream current IP

## Purpose
[OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)](https://obsproject.com/) is free and open source software for video recording and live streaming.<br><br>

This website's purpose is to keep track of the host's IP address, e.g.<br>
`rtmp://192.168.0.1/live/test` 

## Usage
The website shows the host's IP address. <br>
A view enters the websites and copies the address into a video player (e.g. VLC).

## Why???
My team do not wan't to send our IPs via Facebook messenger or similiar application.<br>
That's why we built this. Also, it's easier to redirect people to a website than to a link/message in a conversation.

## DEMO

## Local Development
You can setup a simple PHP server for local development, e.g.<br>
`php -S localhost:9000`

## Note
It's not recommended to publicly display your host's IP.
So, make sure you "hide" the site if you're consider using this.<br><br>

## Contributat
Pull requests are welcome.<br>
The code isn't very pretty at the moment.<br>
I intend to update at a future date :)
